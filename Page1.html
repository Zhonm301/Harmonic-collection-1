    <p2>Even before my eyes opened, I'd felt this strange warmth<br> beaming on my face. I knew that I was lost. <br> I let out a sigh and let go of the rest<br> of the world. I was relieved that I was lost. <br>I touched the long, soft yellow grass and felt<br> the wind through my face and hair. I look down, <br>seeing this white dress on me for the first time.<br> And soon, I knew I would forget all of <br>what is left from the world I left behind.</p2>

<div class="text2">
    <p3> As time passed, I felt a numbness in my brain, <br>as it prevented me from remembering- <br>slowly even losing my train of thoughts.<br>I no longer know the meaning of existance. <br> There is nothing left of me to know or do.<br>
    The only thing left is the cold wind and sun <br>hitting my skin as I sit here, on the grass<br>... This is my escape</p3>
